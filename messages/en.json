        "prayer": "O God, our Father, thank you for having given us Carlo, a model of life for young people and a message of love for all. You have made her fall in love with your Son Jesus, making the Eucharist her 'highway to heaven'. You have given Mary as a beloved Mother, and you have made her become a singer of her tenderness with the Rosary. Accept his intercession for us. He looks above all to the poor, whom he loved and helped. [Grant to me also, through his intercession, the grace I need...] And make our joy full, leading Carlo among the saints of the universal Church, so that his smile may continue to shine for us and for the glory of your name. Amen Pray an Our Father, a Hail Mary and a Glory Be.",
